#' rmar: Regression Model Assessment in R

#'
#' @param known a numeric vector
#' @param predicted a numeric vector or matrix. See Details.
#' @param interval minimum and maximum value of prediction domain. Should be
#' supplied as vector of with two elements. If not supplied is assess from the
#' known argument.
#' @param digits an integer defining the precision of the round function.
#'
#' @details
#' If predicted is a matrix, it should be organized in way that the first column
#' represents the point estimate and the second and third columns represent the
#' lower and upper bound of the predictive interval.
